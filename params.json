It's nowhere near to complete!!\r\n\r\nPatrol is implementation of sentry server in go language.\r\nIt uses sentry protocol so you can use raven clients (currently protocol version 4 is supported).\r\nFrontend is written in angularjs.\r\n\r\nFor demo you can try:\r\n\thttp://demo.patrol.name\r\n\r\n\tusername: demo\r\n\tpassword: demo\r\n\r\nIt's still very limited, under heavy development.\r\n\r\nAs database patrol uses exclusively postgres (for its advanced field types).\r\nFor queue you can currently use either redis or rabbitmq.\r\n\r\nGoal of this project is not to replace sentry with all its features, but\r\ncreate simple, portable, easily deployable solution for logging.\r\n\r\nIn first stable version all the static data will be embedded to binary, so there\r\nwill be ne dependencies.\r\nAll configuration is provided with command line arguments.\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthors:\r\nphonkee\r\n\r\nContributions:\r\nPull requests or ideas are welcome\r\n","google":"UA-58399704-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
